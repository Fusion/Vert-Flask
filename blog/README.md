Blog Blueprint
==============

To create a blog post, create a directory with the desired URL within the 
```posts``` directory. Add the name of that directory to the top of 
```rss.txt``` file in the posts directory.

* The post itself should be put in a "body.html" file in the directory.
* The description should be placed in a "meta.py" file.
