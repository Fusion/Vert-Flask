======================================

Many of us seek to improve ourselves beyond what's required. Many CS students
are not content to just make good grades in class; they want to get their hands
dirty with real-world projects. Many employees read up on the latest languages
and frameworks well beyond office hours, simply because they want to play with
technology while learning to build a better product. It's important, however, 
to ensure our time spent studying new programming techniques does not go to 
waste.


!(confused) != knowledgeable
---------------------------

Understanding an article does not necessarily grant you the knowledge to apply
it directly to your projects. I feel it's easy to mistake lack of confusion for
thorough understanding. In other words, you can glaze over an article and not
feel particularly puzzled by what you just read, yet still have no idea how to
reproduce any examples the moment you close the browser window. I use the following
techniques to help me determine if I've truly understood what I've read.


### Ask Questions. Test Yourself!

If you come across something that doesn't sit right in your head, don't just
think "Hmm, okay, I guess that makes sense." Do your best to figure out the 
*why*, even if that involves moving beyond the article and searching through Google.
Attempt to make slight adjustments to provided examples. Change the problem
requirements if you're reading a book with provided exercises. The goal is deep,
applicable understanding of the subject, and changing examples/problems will
expose you to more edge cases, exceptions, and greatly accelerate your 
understanding. Here are some examples to keep in mind:

* A C tutorial teaches you how to sort an array with hard-coded elements.
Can you alter the example to read inputs from the keyboard? How would you 
account for fewer/more inputs than the array size when sorting?

* A git tutorial teaches you how to revert a commit. How could you revert
multiple commits at the same time if needed?

### Could you explain it without help?


It's not a race.
