excerpt="""Many of us seek to improve ourselves beyond what's required. Many 
CS students are not content to just make good grades in class; they want to 
get their hands dirty with real-world projects. Many employees read up on the 
latest languages and frameworks well beyond office hours, simply because they 
want to play with technology while learning to build a better product. It's 
important, however, to ensure our time spent studying new programming 
techniques does not go to waste."""
