[{{post['title']}}]({{post['url']}})
======================================

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a Python web framework that's steadily
increasing in popularity within the webdev world. After reading so many 
great things about Flask, I decided to try it out myself. I personally find 
testing out a new framework difficult, because you must find a project complex 
enough to reveal the framework's quirks, but not so daunting as to take the 
fun out of the project. Luckily, my PHP/Wordpress powered website filled this
role quite nicely - the website simply consists of static content, a contact
page, and a blog. If I could not convert such a simple site over to Flask, 
I would immediately know that Flask and I would not make a good team.

Spoiler alert: You're reading this on a Flask powered site!

Getting Started
---------------

The first task at hand was simply getting the home, about, services, and work
pages to render correctly. While the task consisted mostly of copying and 
pasting, I was able to immediately apply most of the concepts from the
[Flask quickstart guide][0]. Specifically, I had to learn


* How do I actually start the server?
* Where do my templates go?
* Where do my static assets go?
* How do I retrieve my assets from within the templates?
* How do I route requests?

Sure enough, getting the pure HTML documents to render was pretty simple.
By pure HTML, I mean there were no includes for headers, footers, etc. Thus 
the logical next step was to take these pure HTML documents and DRY up the 
repeating areas.

Growing pains...already?!
------------------------

Coming from PHP, I was used to just `include`-ing the content I wanted and being
done with it.  [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/), Flask's default
templating engine, does not currently support includes. (Note: An `include` 
function [does exist](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#include). However,
I could not get the include function to return non-escaped html. Perhaps this
function was broken in a recent build). Jinja does, however, have 
[template inheritance][1]. To demonstrate, suppose we have a parent 
template `layout.html` 

{% raw %}
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My Website&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;
    &lt;div id="content"&gt;
      {% block body %}{% endblock body %}
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--content--&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--wrapper--&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
{% endraw %}

And a child template `index.html` that inherits the parent and fills in its
blocks
{% raw %}
<pre class="prettyprint">{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %}
  Body content goes here!
{% endblock body %}
</pre>
{% endraw %}

If we were to call [render_template][2] on `index.html`, this is what we
would get.

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My Website&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;
    &lt;div id="content"&gt;
      Body content goes here!
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--content--&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--wrapper--&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

I like the template inheritance pattern of Jinja, but the lack of an include
statement can easily lead to huge parent templates. 

Thankfully, I did find a sufficient workaround to the lack of an include 
statement. Jinja lets you define [Macros][4], which are essentially functions
used within templates to render something. I defined a macro called `nav` that
simply returned the HTML for the navigation. I did the same thing for `header`,
`footer`, and any other sections repeated throughout the site. Take our 
footer, for example.

{% raw %}
<pre class="prettyprint">
{% macro footer() %}
&lt;div id="footer"&gt;
  &lt;div class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="mailto:hi@vertstudios.com"&gt;hi@vertstudios.com&lt;/a&gt; |
    &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/vertstudios"&gt;@vertstudios&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{% endmacro  %}
</pre>
{% endraw %}

Then, from `layouts.html`, I could call the footer macro. Flask requires the 
use of the `|safe` filter if you want to render the returned string. Thus, a 
macro `foo()` can be called from a macro `bar()` without the need to specify 
`{{'{{'}}foo()|safe{{'}}'}}`. But since `layouts.html` is something being
directly rendered, we need to specify `|safe` every time we call a macro.

So the final `layouts.html` ended up looking like

{% raw %}
<pre class="prettyprint">
{% from "sections" import meta_and_css, nav, javascripts, footer %}
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  {{ meta_and_css(g, title)|safe }}
  &lt;body onload="prettyPrint()" id="{{g.bodyID}}"&gt;
&lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;
  {{ nav(g)|safe }}
  &lt;div id="content"&gt;
    {% block body %}{% endblock body %}
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--content--&gt;
  {{ footer()|safe }}
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--wrapper--&gt;
{{ javascripts(g)|safe }}
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
{% endraw %}

This was less than ideal, but it worked; a recurring theme throughout the 
development process that surprisingly didn't bother me so much. 

Being 'Brave'
-------------

Flask didn't always have an out-of-the-box solution to the problem at hand. In 
fact, it *rarely* did. Flask did, however, give me all the tools necessary to 
create whatever I wanted. In a way, I felt that Flask itself was telling me
"Joseph, you're smart enough to implement X functionality on your own... be 
brave for once!"

Sometimes reinventing the wheel is a rewarding exercise. 

The Contact Form
----------------

The recommended method of dealing with forms in Flask is the [Flask-WTF][5]
extension. Flask-WTF has many [built in validation methods][6], but it did not
include validation for a phone number. No big deal, any form library worth its
salt has means for defining custom validation functions. WTForms does in fact
have a mechanism for implementing [custom validators][7], but I did not find 
their examples very pleasing to the eye:

<pre class="prettyprint">
def length(min=-1, max=-1):
    message = 'Must be between %d and %d characters long.' % (min, max)

    def _length(form, field):
        l = field.data and len(field.data) or 0
        if l < min or max != -1 and l > max:
            raise ValidationError(message)

    return _length

class MyForm(Form):
    name = TextField('Name', [Required(), length(max=50)])
</pre>

Consequently, I used Flask-WTF to gather data from the form fields, but I 
rolled my own validation module, which only took about an hour. 

The actual sending of the email was easily handled with Python's built-in
`smtplib` module and Gmail.

The Blog
--------

Creating a blog has become the "Hello, World" of web application frameworks.
While [Python blogging software][8] does exist, it seemed like it would take
longer to integrate an existing blogging platform into my Flask project than
just rolling my own. 

For the past year or so, I've longed for a file-system based blogging platform.
Writing my articles in VIM + Markdown is **so** much more enjoyable than
writing HTML in VIM, moving the HTML over to Wordpress, previewing the HTML, 
making sure the formatting is right, and other annoying steps. 

There were a few specific things I needed to accomplish with the blog:

* Ability to generate an RSS feed
* The URLs of the blog posts must be the same as before.
* Pagination

Without the need to generate an RSS feed, the only thing I would need to do is
route `/blog/<post>/` to a function that attempts to render a template 
named `/blog/the-post-url`, and return a 404 if that template isn't found. 
The RSS requirement, however, forced me to think how I should go about storing
the meta data for each post.

I settled on a fairly simple structure that, while not beautiful or clever,
works good enough for me. I create a directory in `/blog/posts/` named `desired
-post-url`. Within that directory, I create two files: `meta.py` and `body.html
`. `meta.py` just contains a few variables for metadata (date posted, excerpt, 
etc), and body.html has the post body. 

To avoid having to parse through all the metadata files to figure out the
order of the posts for the RSS feed, I just prepend the directory name to the
top of a file called `rss.txt`. Again, not the most beautiful thing in the 
world but it's a system that I find easy to understand and easy to work with.

The RSS feed and blog pagination are handled in the same step. I run a script
called `genfeed.py` which creates the rss xml file and pagination files.
Using static files generated by the `geenfeed.py` script (which reads the
`rss.txt` script mentioned earlier) for pagination makes sense because the
pagination should only change whenever I update/create a story. 

### Importing my Blog Posts

To import my Wordpress posts into this new structure, all I had to do was
parse Wordpress's export xml file with [PyQuery][9] and create the files with
standard library functions. I didn't bother to convert the posts from Wordpress
to Markdown, so all old posts you look through in the source will have normal
HTML.


Structural Troubles
-------------------

One of the biggest troubles I faced throughout the site development was how
to import things into particular files. This [StackOverflow answer][10] 
describes the steps necessary to import a module in a parent/sibling directory
when running a script directly. Consequently, any scripts that needed access to
the `app` object (which holds a lot of important methods and attributes about
the application instance), I had to either run 
`python -m mywebsite.blog.genfeed`, or just move `genfeed.py` to the same
directory as `mywebsite.py`, which would enable me to run `python genfeed.py`. 
I chose the latter out of sheer laziness, though I'm not particularly happy
I had to make such a choice. I should note that this is not a Flask specific 
issue, but a Python issue.

Development vs Production Environment
-------------------------------------

In development, all assets are served from the static files. In production,
all assets are served from S3. The environment is set by a env-var called
`FLASK_ENV`. I needed a way to let my templates know "Hey, you're in the
production environment, you should link to S3 files instead of static files!".
I decided to take advantage of Flask's `g` object, which is a global object
that exists througout the request context. You're free to populate it with
whatever you want. I created and used the property `g.assets`.

While this suited my needs perfectly, it caused my templates to appear 
slightly less pretty. Anytime I wanted to call a macro that looks for the 
`g.assets` property, I'd obviously have to pass `g` to it. For example,
here's the definition of the `img` macro, a function used to render images
on the site:

{% raw %}
<pre class="prettyprint">
{% macro img(g, file, alt="", class="") %}
&lt;img 
  src="{{g.assets}}/images/{{file}}" 
  alt="{{alt}}" 
  class="{{class}}" 
  /&gt;
{% endmacro %}
</pre>
{% endraw %}

And example call to the macro:
{% raw %}
<pre class="prettyprint">
{{img(g, "pointer.png", "", "pointer")|safe }}
</pre>
{% endraw %}

It's more verbose than what I'd really like, but it gets the job done.

Going Live with Nginx and uWSGI
-------------------------------

Now that my project was pretty much finished, it was time to put the files
on my Linode VPS and show my project to the world! I decided to use Nginx with
uWSGI, simply because that's the combination I've seen a lot of articles on.
Flask itself [has documentation][11] on uWSGI. However, I found parts of the
documentation inadequate.

From the documentation:

<pre class="prettyprint">
# Given a flask application in myapp.py, use the following command:
$ uwsgi -s /tmp/uwsgi.sock --module myapp --callable app
</pre>

If you want to put a project on a live server, there's no way you should have
to do so much work! uWSGI has [ini configuration files][12] that I took full
advantage of. Now, instead of executing a verbose command from the shell, I can
simply execute

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ uwsgi uwsgi.ini
</pre>

My `uwsgi.ini` is as follows:

<pre class="prettyprint">
[uwsgi]
project = vertstudios
daemonize = /var/log/nginx/access.log
master = true
chdir = /var/www/vertstudios.com
socket = 127.0.0.1:5000
wsgi = %(project):app 
virtualenv = env/
pidfile = /var/run/uwsgi/%(project).pid 
touch-reload  = /var/run/uwsgi/%(project).pid  
processes = 3 
procname-prefix = %(project)
</pre>

An explanation for the parameters:  

* project: The module name where you call `app.run()`.  
* daemonize: If you want to daemonize. Provide a log file path.
* master: Boolean indicating if you want a master process. Master processes
         make [uwsgi management][13] *much* easier.
* chdir: Change directory. Essentially lets you keep parameters such as 
       "project" and virtualenv relative to the path provided to chdir.
* socket: A Unix socket path or TCP socket info
* wsgi: %(the module containing app):app
* virtualenv: Path to the virtualenv for the project.
* pidfile: Where the master process pid file will be written.
* touch-reload: Touching this file causes the processes to reload (convenient!)
* processes: How many processes you want running (not including master process)
* procname-prefix: Process name prefix. Useful for `ps aux | grep myapp`

Now, for the parts of my nginx config relevant to uWSGI:

<pre class="prettyprint">
# Redirect everything to the main site.
server {
  server_name www.vertstudios.com;
  return 301 http://vertstudios.com$request_uri;
}

server {
  server_name vertstudios.com;
  location / { try_files $uri @flaskapp; }
  location @flaskapp {
    include uwsgi_params;
    uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:5000;
  }
}
</pre>

TODO
----

* I plan on exporting my Wordpress comments to Disqus. I enjoy interacting with 
people that read my articles, and I'd like to preserve the comments I've 
already acquired.

* I've managed to break a few links. In particular, I've broken links to php
files I stupidly used to demo some of my jQuery plugins.

* Using [prettify][14] for syntax highlighting means I have to still use &lt;pre&gt;
tags in my documents, since the script requires a class of "prettyprint" on
those tags. I'll either adjust prettyprint js and styles myself, find an 
alternative syntax highlighter, or do some processing of the markup to append
the "prettyprint" class whenever it finds the &lt;pre&gt; tag.

* Still need to set up git deployment. I'm currently just pulling from a 
private bitbucket repo on my server.

* I need to automate my build workflow. A single bash script should concat all
my CSS/JS files, run YUICompressor, and upload the files to S3.

* I really need to implement meta description tags for my posts...but that
  would require me to actually write them.
